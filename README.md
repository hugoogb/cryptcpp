# Cryptography in C++

## Introduction

This program writed in C++ is used to encrypt and decrypt messages with different methods.

I did it for a high school project and now that in studying software engineering I'm trying to improve the whole program.

Right now it's so simple, I know, but I will be upgrading it as soon as I can.
You can see all I want to do inside the project by checking the [TODO.md] file.

## Prerequisites

- G++ Compiler
- GNU make

## Intalling

- 1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hugoogb/cryptography-cpp.git
```

- 2. Run make in the cloned directory

```sh
make
```

If you want to clean the directory (executable and .o): ```make clean```

- 3. Execute the main binary created

```sh
./main
```

## You're all set up and ready to start encrypting ;) !!!
